# Multiple-threads

* This project is analysis the performance variation by using different number of threads when operating the matrix multiplication
* The work is using C and adopts [windows.h](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/procthread/creating-threads) library to control and assignment the task to each thread
* The result of the experiment is shown as the [report](https://github.com/yuchehuang/Multiple-threads/blob/master/Report/Thread%20performance%20analysis.pdf)
